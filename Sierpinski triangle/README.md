## Sierpinski triangle

The Sierpi≈Ñski triangle is a fractal set, in the shape of repeating equilaterial triangles. There are several different ways of constructing the fractal.

Here, I focus on the Chaos game construction.

Set-up:
* Take 3 points in the plane, forming a triangle.
* Randomly select a point within the triangle as your initial position.

The game:
1. Randomly select one of the 3 original vertex points.
2. Draw a new point halfway between your current position and the selected vertex point. This is your new position.
3. Repeat the above two steps a lot of times.
